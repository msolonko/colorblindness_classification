# Color Blindness Chart Classification

Being mildly colorblind, I wanted to make a program that would take colorblindness charts and accurately classify them. Using the MNIST dataset, computer vision (OpenCV), and deep learning (Tensorflow), I accomplished this task.

I made an article about this project on Medium, which you can view [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/reading-color-blindness-charts-deep-learning-and-computer-vision-a8c824dd71cd?source=email-fe4b70c28b97-1580052047064-layerCake.autoLayerCakeWriterNotification-------------------------df569f02_28eb_4322_b9cf_cb6f0945a98d&sk=).
